      "text": "The spiral patterns evident in elongated organs such as pine cones, Basic model\nfir cones and pineapples, can be described by models that position\ncomponents, in this case scales, on the surface of a cylinder. Van Iterson\n[75] divides phyllotactic patterns on cylinders into simple and conjugate\nones. In the case of a simple arrangement, all components lie on a single\n_generative helix_. In contrast, conjugate patterns consist of two or more\ninterleaved helices.",
